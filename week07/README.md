# SYS 611: Week 7 Examples

Paul T. Grogan <pgrogan@stevens.edu>

This week's lecture discusses dynamic simulation with discrete and continuous time examples. Example Python files for this week are:
 * DelaySystem - almost the simplest possible example of a discrete time simulation. Trivially stores inputs in a state variable.
 * BinaryCounter - simple system that is capable of counting up to 2.
 * FlipFlop - digital component with a one-bit memory that stores inputs in a state variable.
 * EulerIntegration - simple approximation of differential equations for continuous time simulation.
 * NumericalIntegration - use scipy's odeint library for better numerical integration.
