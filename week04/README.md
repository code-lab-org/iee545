# SYS 611: Week 4 Examples

Paul T. Grogan <pgrogan@stevens.edu>

This week's lecture discusses modeling tools as a precursor to simulation. Example Python files for this week are:
 * DiceFightersMonteCarlo - an updated implementation of the Dice Figters example problem using Monte Carlo simulation
 * BuffonsNeedle - the Buffon's Needle experiment as a Monte Carlo simulation
 * BuffonsNeedleAnthetic- an updated implementation of the Buffon's Needle experiment using antithetic variables
