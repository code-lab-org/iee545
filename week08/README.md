# SYS 611: Week 8 Examples

Paul T. Grogan <pgrogan@stevens.edu>

This week's lecture discusses dynamic simulation with discrete and continuous time examples. Example Python files for this week are:
 * WeatherMarkovModel - simulation for state transitions in a discrete-time Markov chain model for weather conditions.
 * ConditionalExponential - script to illustrate the Markov property of an exponential distribution.
 * QueuingMarkovModel - simulation for state transitions in a continuous-time Markov process for a single-server queuing system.
